## Confluence Search Setup

This repo provides instructions for adding Confluence as a Chrome search engine.

**Note:** Chrome removed OpenSearch auto-discovery in March 2023, so users need to manually add the search engine. The page provides easy copy-paste values to make this quick.

Users visit the page and follow the 3-step process to add Confluence search (shortcut: `cf`) to their Chrome address bar.
