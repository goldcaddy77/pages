GitHub Pages site for hosting OpenSearch configurations.

## Confluence Search Setup

This repo provides a one-click Chrome OpenSearch setup for Confluence.

**Before deploying:**
1. Edit `confluence-search.xml` and replace `your-confluence.atlassian.net` with your actual Confluence domain
2. Update the same URL in `index.html` instructions

Once published via GitHub Pages, users can visit the site and Chrome will auto-detect the search engine or they can manually add it following the on-page instructions.
